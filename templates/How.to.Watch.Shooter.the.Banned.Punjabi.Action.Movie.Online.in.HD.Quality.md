Shooter is based on the true story of Sukha Kahlon, a notorious gangster who was killed in 2015. The movie depicts his rise and fall in the world of crime, his rivalry with other gangs, his love life and his encounters with the police. The movie also features some of his real-life videos and audios that he used to upload on social media.
 
The movie was originally titled Sukha Kahlon, but it was changed to Shooter after the Haryana government banned it. The makers of the movie claimed that they did not intend to glorify crime or violence, but to show the reality of the situation in Punjab. They also said that they made some changes in the script and the dialogues to avoid any controversy or hurt any sentiments.
 
Shooter received mixed reviews from the critics and the audience. Some praised the movie for its action sequences, cinematography and performances, while others criticized it for its weak plot, poor editing and excessive violence. The movie also faced some competition from other Punjabi movies that released around the same time, such as Jinde Meriye and Zakhmi.
