The film follows the Nohara family and their friends as they visit a safari park where animals from all over the world live freely. However, they soon discover that the park is actually a secret base for an evil organization called Wild Animals Kingdom (WAK), which plans to use a device called the Animalizer to turn humans into animals and take over the world. Shinnosuke and his friends must stop WAK and save their parents from becoming animalized.
 
The film features guest voice actors such as Rie Kugimiya as Tamiko Kaneari, a WAK agent who can communicate with animals; Hiroshi Kamiya as KojirÅ Kasuga, a WAK scientist who invented the Animalizer; and Masaharu Fukuyama as Hiroshi's old friend and a famous wildlife photographer.

He decided to create a new world where animals can live peacefully without human interference.
 
Shinnosuke and his friends manage to rescue Hiroshi and Misae, who are about to be animalized by Shizime. However, they are surrounded by Shizime's army of animalized humans and animals.
